<h2 id="top">Building ORBIS: Historical evidence</h2>

<p>This section offers a general overview of the data and assumptions on which our model simulations are based. In most cases, it would have been possible to include much more detailed information. Even so, in the interest of accessibility we have sought to keep this survey to a manageable length and refrain from detailed discussion of the finer points of historical interpretation or technological issues. We expect that several features and implications of the model will be reviewed in greater depth in a number of publications by individual contributors, which will be referenced here as they become available.[<a id="cite1" href="#fn1" title="Forthcoming studies include a survey of the model with illustrations of its applicability to broader historical questions, a separate analysis of the maritime cost data in the tetrarchic price edict of 301 CE, and a detailed review of Roman travel speeds currently prepared by Scheidel (Scheidel in preparation a, b, c), a formal presentation of the projection of sailing speed developed by Arcenas, and an assessment of the value of Roman itinerary records by Padilla Peralta and Weiland. Meeks has discussed aspects of his work at https://dhs.stanford.edu/author/emeeks/.">1</a>] Building ORBIS is an ongoing process and we welcome and encourage comments, queries, and constructive criticism addressed to orbisproject@stanford.edu.

<h3 id="sites">Sites</h3>

<p>The network is organized around 632 sites. Most of them represent urban settlements of the Roman period, supplemented by a number of promontories and other landmarks that were significant for travel. With few minor adjustments, labeled sites are named in accordance with our map source (Talbert 2000). Labeled sites have been ranked in five categories of size and importance in keeping with the classification system in the map key of the same reference work. In some cases, rankings have been adjusted to correct for inconsistencies between different maps in Talbert 2000[<a id="cite2" href="#fn2" >2</a>].  On the <a href="#" onclick="goTab(5)">network map</a>, the size of sites reflects their relative standing. Sites that are not settlements were consistently assigned the lowest of the five ranks.</p>

<p>301 of the sites function as sea ports. In antiquity, most of them were located on the coast, although a few of them no longer are, due to changes in the coastline. Nineteen of the sea ports are connected to the sea by rivers but were accessible to seagoing ships. Except in a very few cases in which these ports are relatively far removed from the coast, these fluvial connections have not been separately classified as river routes. Owing to the impact of the tides that supported upriver navigation, sea ports situated on rivers were common on the Atlantic shores of the Roman Empire. A number of sites on rivers or the coast are connected to the network by more than one mode of transportation.</p>

<p>The sites included in the network account for only a small fraction of the thousands of sites recorded in Talbert 2000. In selecting them, priority was given to cities of considerable size and importance: most of the sites that Talbert 2000 ranks in the top two tiers and actually belong in this category are part of the network. Other sites are included either thanks to their regional or historical importance or, and above all, due to their function within the Roman road network. In keeping with the overall perspective of this project, the model privileges sites that were situated at the intersection or the end of major roads.</p>

<p>We are exploring ways of providing richer historical context for this selection of nodal sites, such as the addition of a large number of other Roman-era settlements in order to facilitate orientation and navigation on the network map at high levels of resolution.</p>

<h4>Routes</h4>
<p>The model allows movement along 900 maritime connections between coastal sites, which can be ports or landmarks such as promontories or river mouths. These routes were established by privileging sea lanes that are documented in ancient sources, drawing in the first instance on the evidence gathered by Pascal Arnaud for the Mediterranean (Arnaud 2005) and the Black Sea (1992)[<a id="cite3" href="#fn3">3</a>].  These connections were supplemented by creating short-distance routes that link adjacent coastal sites along coasts or across island chains and by a small number of additional medium-distance routes inspired by comparative historical data that address gaps in the ancient coverage. Due to the lack of usable evidence, Atlantic sea routes were in their entirety supplied by linking relevant ports in a deliberately conservative fashion[<a id="cite4" href="#fn4">4</a>].  The Red Sea (and, by extension, part of the Indian Ocean) may be included at a later date.</p>

<p>The resultant network roughly approximates the preferred routes of sailors in the Roman period. By adopting this template, the model follows Arnaud's persuasive interpretation of ancient maritime networks of commerce as relying on a modest number of segmented routes that combined high sea crossings with coastal connections and thereby imposed structured connectivity on seascapes (e.g., Arnaud 2005, 2007). This approach seems preferable to one that we considered at an earlier stage of the project, which would have allowed direct connections between any two coastal sites within a given radius, generously set at 500 miles to approximate the distance between Alexandria and Crete. This method would have created over 10,000 discrete routes and was abandoned when it became clear that it would take months of continuous computing to simulate all these connections and therefore require access to high-speed computing resources. More importantly, this approach would have created a speciously efficient sailing environment that reduced cost and friction below historically plausible levels. It turned out to be unfeasible for us for the same reason why it would have been unmanageably complex for ancient sailors: in both cases, information costs – the ancient cost associated with commanding knowledge of the properties of a vast number of direct routes as well as the modern cost arising from heavy computational loads – were too high.</p>

<p>Sea routes are treated as accessible at all times of the year but cannot traverse areas where wave heights of at least 12 feet are encountered for at least 10 percent of the time in a given month, a condition that serves as a proxy of stormy weather (National Imagery and Mapping Agency 2002). In the Roman world, such weather events were limited to the Atlantic and, in the winter, the northwestern Mediterranean south of France[<a id="cite5" href="#fn5">5</a>].  Thanks to this absolute constraint, the model severely curtails sailing options in the Atlantic during the winter months. Sea ice would not normally have been present.[<a id="cite6" href="#fn6">6</a>]  The fact that outside specified areas of particularly rough weather, sea lanes are considered usable throughout the winter does not mean that sea travel was equally likely to occur at different times of the year. Both ancient and subsequent premodern sources emphasize the hazards of winter sailing and envision more or less formal constraints on maritime movement in that season (e.g., Ramsay 1904: 376; Goitein 1967: 316-7; Leighton 1972: 132; Meijer 1983; Ohler 1989: 11; Jehel 1993: 315-6; Braudel 1995: 248-9; Horden and Purcell 2000: 137-43; McCormick 2001: 444-68). However, as there is no evidence of a generalized closure of the seas at any time of the year, the model seeks to mirror reality by providing the option of travel even under unfavorable conditions and at times when it would have been effectively rare.</p>

<p>For purely pragmatic reasons, the model considers five of the sea routes to have been continually operational. Three of them are essentially "ferry routes" across the Bosporus, the Dardanelles and the Strait of Messina, which are needed to connect Europe to Asia and Sicily to Italy. The two others cross the Strait of Gibraltar and the Strait of Dover to maintain links between Europe and North Africa and between mainland Europe and Britain. These routes are considered operational even when the option of travel by sea is otherwise disabled for the purpose of route simulation. This assumption is consistent with meteorological data in that none of these connections (with only one minor exception) would have been routinely interrupted even during the winter.</p>

<h4 id="seatime">Time</h4>

<p>Time cost is determined by three factors: winds, currents, and navigational capabilities. Monthly wind data for the Mediterranean and the Atlantic were derived from National Imagery and Mapping Agency 2002. Data for the Black Sea were only available in a somewhat different format (Great Britain, Meteorological Office 1963), which might account for slight discontinuities in simulation outcomes.[<a id="cite7" href="#fn7">7</a>] Winds were incorporated into the model in the way described by Scott Arcenas in "<a href="#" onclick="goTab(6)">Applying ORBIS</a>:" meteorological information about the speed and direction of winds in different sectors of the sea was combined with experimental data concerning the performance of square-rigged vessels in a variety of wind conditions and historical evidence for maximum sailing velocity made good in order to model the movement of Roman-style sailing ships across the sea. Current constraints were only included in areas where they were unusually powerful: in descending order of significance, in the Bosporus, the Dardanelles, and the Strait of Gibraltar.[<a id="cite8" href="#fn8">8</a>]  Seasonal costs for storm conditions were applied to transits through the Strait of Messina in the winter months.[<a id="cite9" href="#fn9">9</a>]  Currents in the Strait of Bonifacio (between Corsica and Sardinia) and in the Strait of Dover were insufficiently significant or regular to be included.[<a id="cite10" href="#fn10">10</a>]  In most parts of the Mediterranean and the coastal Atlantic, surface currents do not normally exceed 0.5 knots except in strong winds, a background influence that would not make a large difference to our simulations and was therefore excluded from our model.[<a id="cite11" href="#fn11">11</a>]  Although feasible in principle, the inclusion of currents raises modeling challenges because they act on seaborne vessels differently from wind and, more importantly, the force of surface currents themselves is to a significant extent determined by wind strength in ways that may also affect their direction. Future development of the model may include experiments with the impact of currents and its interaction with wind.</p>

<p>The parameters underlying the model's simulation of sailing capabilities are explained by Arcenas in "<a href="#" onclick="goTab(6)">Applying ORBIS</a>." The model offers the option of maritime travel using two different types of sailing ship which differ in terms of their ability to sail against the wind. We refrained from adding a separate option for oar-propelled vessels given that sailing was the principal means of maritime travel.</p>

<p>Simulated sailing times constitute mathematical averages that simulate the path and speed of a ship that experiences wind proportionate to the overall distribution of its strength and direction in a given month. They are not meant to reflect the actual experience of any given ship following a specific route but rather the cumulative experience of an infinite number of ships undertaking the same voyage, averaged across all individual outcomes. This approach emphasizes the structural properties of each route, which are of central importance to our understanding of the nature of the network as a whole.</p>

<p>Simulations were checked against over 200 historically documented sailing times, not all of which were suitable for calibration purposes. Calibration relied on a reference sample of 117 sea routes for which putatively common sailing times or time proxies in the form of notional distances are recorded in ancient sources, and which were gathered from Arnaud 2005 and other resources. For the routes contained in this sample, mean simulated sailing speeds for the slower ship type are approximately one-sixth lower than for the faster one. This range not only underlines the approximate nature of the simulations but also reflects uncertainty about the most appropriate method of calibration. In statistical terms, the model's two sailing modes generate two significantly different outcomes. Applying the slightly faster sailing mode, simulated travel times in excess of 24 hours cluster around the values reported in the reference sample. (Among the Mediterranean routes, where the reference data are of somewhat superior quality, almost all simulated outcomes differ by less than plus or minus 30 percent from reported values, as indicated by the orange box.) Beyond trips of up to 24 hours, these deviations cumulatively cancel each other out, so that the average sailing time for all simulated voyages is virtually the same as the mean of all reported sailing times in the reference sample.</p>

<div class="inlinepic"><img src="figures/fig_b1.png" width="540" height="399" /><p><span class="caption">Figure B1. </span></p></div>
<div class="inlinepic"><img src="figures/fig_b2.png" width="540" height="381" /><p><span class="caption">Figure B2. </span></p></div>

<p>These findings suggest that the model's simulations are reliable in the aggregate if we proceed from the assumption that they should on average match reported travel times. While this may well be the most reasonable interpretation, concerns arise from the fact that in this scenario a large number of voyages are faster than expected. This is a problem because whereas actual travel times may frequently have exceeded expected values due to meteorological and navigational difficulties, they were less likely to fall short of them by a significant margin. Sailing speed cannot be expected to follow a normal distribution around a mean or median but is more heavily constrained on the high end than on the low end: ships are not normally capable of surpassing routine speeds by a wide margin but are always able to move much more slowly than usual. This raises concerns that a simulation that often over-performs relative to reported expectations might generate outcomes that are somewhat too optimistic overall. The slower sailing mode, by contrast, projects somewhat longer travel times for most routes, an outcome that might be preferable to the extent that reported expectations were slanted towards somewhat favorable conditions and therefore failed to approximate statistically average outcomes.</p>

<div class="inlinepic"><img src="figures/fig_b3.png" width="540" height="380" /><p><span class="caption">Figure B3.</span></p></div>
<div class="inlinepic"><img src="figures/fig_b4.png" width="540" height="381" /><p><span class="caption">Figure B4.</span></p></div>

<p>Both sets of simulations produce defensible outcomes. Instead of deciding between them, we prefer to present them as a range of outcomes that broadly match ancient expectations and therefore presumably circumscribe actual experience.</p>

<p>As is clear from the above charts, in both sailing modes very short simulated trips (of up to 24 hours) take much longer than reported. We consider this a strength rather than a flaw of the model. Trips that were expected to be completed between dusk and dawn or within 24 hours were governed by different choices than longer trips, in that meteorological conditions at the time of departure would have been of critical importance: trips were either undertaken under reasonably favorable circumstances or postponed. In this context, statistically average travel times would bear little relation to expected travel times, which cannot have been meant to include delays at the point of departure. Our simulations arguably improve on these reported expectations by factoring delays into overall outcomes: to give a simple example, a trip that would ordinarily take one day to complete but was on average only convenient on two days out of three would be assigned a mean duration of 1.5 days by our model. By coming closer to capturing the true cost of short-haul communications, the simulations are bound consistently to exceed reported expectations by a significant margin. This is borne out by the deviations charted in the above graphs, which show a clear discontinuity between day trips and longer voyages. This observation is consistent with comparative historical evidence of an inverse relationship between the length of voyages and the degree of variance in travel time (Braudel 1995: 364).</p>

<p>The model's simulations represent a radical departure from the conventional practice of estimating Roman sailing times from anecdotal references or attempts to derive average nautical speeds from relating documented durations to geographical distance. The statistically average character of the simulated outcomes requires them to exceed reported record times of particularly fast voyages, an expectation that is borne out by comparison between simulated and reported record speeds (e.g., Ramsay 1904: 379; Braudel 1995: 358-63; Casson 1995: 282-8; Arnaud 2005: 102). In practice, however, many actual voyages would have been slower than predicted by our simulations. For instance, even if they took place between the same start and end points without intermediate stops, they may have been marred by navigational shortcomings or costly constraints imposed by local preference, whereas the model simulations always select the optimal path for a given route, a degree of perfection that cannot readily be ascribed to real-life sailors. Vagaries of local geography, such as problems in entering or leaving ports under certain wind conditions, would have imposed costs that cannot be predicted by the model. More importantly, at least some of the historical sea voyages for which times are recorded may have been discontinuous, extended by undocumented layovers in ports or at anchorages. This makes it likely that simulated outcomes are faster than most recorded individual voyages, a prediction that is likewise consistent with preliminary tests.</p>

<p>As explained in "<a href="#" onclick="goRemoteTab(2,'understanding_tabs',0)">Understanding ORBIS,</a>" users need to be aware of the specific character of the model's simulations to appreciate their uses and limitations for historical study. The model allows users to adapt simulated outcomes to reflect different preferences. The option to disable open sea routes makes it possible to simulate, albeit very roughly, the practice of cabotage by constricting maritime movement to coastal routes and short-range movement between islands. This effect can be enhanced by restricting coastal sailing to daylight hours. Users who wish to add a further element of verisimilitude may simply choose to add a certain time cost to any port included in a voyage, a function that is not provided on this site but can easily be performed on an ad hoc basis. It is particularly advisable to allow for extra time in entering sea ports that are situated on rivers, a process that relied on tidal currents.</p>

<p>For routes that traverse more than one medium - land, rivers, or sea -, neglect of the time cost of transfers between different types of transportation is likely to be the most significant source of discrepancies between our model simulations and Roman real-life experiences. In order to account for this problem, the upgraded version of the site allows users to add transfer times (in daily increments) at various transition points, most notably ports.</p>

<h4 id="seaexpense">Expense<a href="#top"><img src="images/contents.png" width="100" height="12" border="0"/></a></h4>

<p>Maritime freight charges have been derived from the price ceilings stipulated by the tetrarchic price edict of 301 CE. This text records 51 prices for different routes, 49 of which are identifiable (Arnaud 2007: 336). Prices range from 4 to 26 <span class="italic">denarii communes</span> for the transport of 1 <span class="italic">modius kastrensis</span> (about 12.9 liters). Earlier attempts to employ these values in estimates of Roman shipping costs sought to relate them to direct geographical distance (e.g., Duncan-Jones 1982: 367-8; cf. Rougé 1966: 98-9). As Arnaud recently recognized, the problem with this approach lies in the fact that distances may not have been known or were in any case not particularly relevant per se; instead, travel time would have served as a critical determinant of monetary cost. Prior to the creation of the present model, it was not possible to test most of the edict’s maritime freight rates against probable travel times. This is largely a function of the idiosyncratic character of the document, which centers on relations between the major political centers and secondary nodes and shows little overlap with records regarding well-established routes for which travel times or time proxies in the form of notional distances are reported in ancient geographical sources.[<a id="cite12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</p>

<p>The model follows Arnaud’s intuition that the price ceilings recorded in the edict correspond to sailing times (Arnaud 2007: 330). The model’s simulations based on the faster sailing ship support Arnaud’s equation of 1 <span class="italic">denarius</span> with 1 day of travel (Scheidel 2013). Although the slower sailing mode would produce a somewhat different ratio, the model adopts this deliberately conservative equation to avoid exaggerating the price difference between cheap maritime travel and costlier modes of transport. Almost 80 percent of variance in price is explained by time cost. This finding indicates that the maritime price ceilings imposed by the price edict were far less vitiated by bureaucratic misapprehensions than has customarily been assumed.</p>

<div class="inlinepic"><img src="figures/fig_b5.png" width="412" height="442" /><p><span class="caption">Figure B5.</span></p></div>

<p>In keeping with the proposed benchmark rate of 1 <span class="italic">denarius</span> per <span class="italic">modius kastrensis</span> per day, the model applies an expense of 0.1 <span class="italic">denarii</span> per 1 kilogram of wheat per day. The schematic conversion ratio (in section XXXVA.25-6 of the Aphrodisias copy of the price edict) that equates the cost of transporting a passenger by sea to the cost of shipping 25 <span class="italic">modii kastrenses</span> and yields a simulation rate of 25.2 <span class="italic">denarii</span> per passenger per day seems unduly low even for a passenger in steerage, given that the allowance of 323 liters (or one-third of a cubic meter) creates just about enough space for a person standing up straight. As already noted before (Duncan-Jones 1982: 386), the edict appears to understate the cost of passenger travel relative to that of goods.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that even disregarding this last issue, the edict’s figures provide at best a very rough sense of actual prices and price ratios, which must have depended on a variety of factors such as cargo type, ship size, season, tolls, and so forth. At the same time, the fact that Roman rule had created a relatively safe and predictable environment for maritime transport and traders would therefore have been less exposed to toll predation, piracy and other vagaries of commercial activity than in many other periods raises the possibility that variation in actual pricing might have been relatively muted (Scheidel 2011). In this context, even the crude representations of the price edict may be accepted as a serviceable index of shipping costs for the purpose of simulating the properties of the network as a whole. Future iterations of the model might seek to fine-tune these simulations by applying a sliding-scale discount function in order to accommodate trends in price/time ratios. Given the fairly crude character of the underlying data set, this cannot be expected to make a great difference overall. The main value of the expense simulation lies in highlighting the massive impact of cost differences between maritime and other forms of transport on the structure of the system. It also reinforces our understanding of the Mediterranean Sea as the essential core of the Roman imperial network, as illustrated in our distance cartograms. No plausible adjustment of the model parameters could alter this fundamental fact.</p>

<h3 id="roadtransport">Road transport<a href="#top"><img src="images/contents.png" width="100" height="12" border="0" /></a></h3>

<h4 id="roadroutes">Routes</h4>

<p>The baseline model contains 814 road segments that allow movement in both directions. The total length of this road network is 84,631 kilometers. While this matches conventional estimates of 80-100,000 kilometers for the principal Roman road network, the cumulative length of all the land routes depicted in Talbert 2000 must be considerably greater even than that. Our guiding principle in selecting road routes was to ensure adequate levels of connectivity throughout the Roman Empire. The model therefore seeks to include the most important roads as well as those required to reach all peripheral regions or maintain links between arterial roads. The model prioritizes radial arterial roads that connect center to periphery over orbital roads that link the former.[<a id="cite13" href="#fn13">13</a>]  The selection process was informed by the paths of the routes listed in Roman itineraries, which were included as comprehensively as possible whenever they tracked major roads.[<a id="cite14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</p>

<p>The trajectories of most of the roads covered by the model follow the information given in Talbert 2000 (see "Building ORBIS: Geospatial technology: Roads") or are interpolated wherever the atlas does not offer a precise reconstruction. In a few cases, gaps in coverage were closed with the help of additional map resources for the southern Balkans (Koder et al. 1976; Soustal 1981), northern Mesopotamia (Stier et al. 1991), and the western Egyptian desert (Fakhry 1974)[<a id="cite15" href="#fn15">15</a>]. In Upper Egypt, where the precise location of roads is notoriously unclear, the model assumes a single road along the Nile instead of separate ones on each river bank, a simplification that does not significantly affect overall cost outcomes. The model adopts another simplifying assumption by treating most roads as equivalent in terms of their physical condition and hence expected speed on level ground. An exception is made for caravan tracks in the Egyptian desert, which are considered unsuitable for certain types of travel (vehicles and horse relays).</p>

<p>Chronological differentiation within the network remains unfeasible except in very rough terms and would seem inadvisable given that an absence of Roman-built roads cannot be taken to imply an absence of preceding terrestrial transport routes. The model does not faithfully reflect conditions at any particular point in time but for practical reasons treats all Roman-era features documented in Talbert 2000 as effectively contemporaneous.</p>

<p>In keeping with the model's focus on large-scale connectivity, simulations of road routes work best over longer distances. Connections within regions may require detours that would have been made unnecessary by secondary roads that are not included in the model network, and most settlements that existed in the Roman period are not directly connected to the network at all. Enhanced articulation of the road network will require the addition of further sites and roads, work that is currently underway. The magnitude of this task is underscored by the fact that even excluding all bottom-tier settlements, Talbert 2000 shows more than 3,000 Roman-era sites, four times the number of sites in the model, not all of which are urban settlements.[<a id="cite16" href="#fn16">16</a>] </p>

<p>Road distances have been determined by measuring the routes derived from Talbert 2000 and other resources referenced in the previous section (see "Building ORBIS: Geospatial technology: Roads"). Due to the large scale of the maps that were utilized in generating the model's road network, road paths cannot be expected to match Roman roads with precision but are bound to be somewhat straighter and therefore somewhat shorter than in reality. Given Roman preference for straight roads, any such deviations are probably modest and unlikely to affect simulated cost outcomes in any significant way: the underlying time and expense parameters play a much greater role than distance in determining cost. Even so, we tested the hypothesis that measured road routes might be somewhat too short by comparing them to corresponding distances recorded in Roman itineraries. This hypothesis was not supported by the historical data (see Dan-el Padilla Peralta's summary in "<a href="#" onclick="goTab(6)">Applying ORBIS</a>"[<a id="cite17" href="#fn17">17</a>].</p>

<h4 id="roadtime">Time<a href="#top"><img src="images/contents.png" width="100" height="12" border="0" /></a></h4>

<p>Roman roads were used by a wide variety of pedestrians, animals and vehicles, and at an even wider variety of velocities. Time costs were determined not only by means of transport but by road quality, the spacing of suitable rest stops, grade, obstructions such as bodies of water, and seasonal constraints from spring floods to summer heat and winter ice and snow. The model captures only the most important types of time cost in what is inevitably a highly generalized fashion. Numerous studies were employed in establishing simulation parameters (key works include Ludwig 1897; Ramsay 1904; Riepl 1913; Renouard 1962; Vigneron 1968: 134-7, 171-6; Chevallier 1976: 191-8; Dubois 1986; Cotterell et al. 1990: 193-233; Laurence 1999: 78-94; Kolb 2000: 308-32; Matthews 2000; McCormick 2001: 474-81; further on antiquity, see also Hunter 1913; Ramsay 1925; Yeo 1946; Eliot 1955; Forbes 1955: 131-92; Burford 1960; Engels 1978: 15-6; Röring 1983; Sippel 1987; Hyland 1990; Polfer 1991; Stoffel 1994: 161-5; Erdkamp 1998: 72-3; Roth 1999: 205-13; Raepsaet 2002, 2008; Adams 2007; and for further comparanda, e.g., Leonard 1894; Renouard 1961: 110-17; Goitein 1967: 290; Clark and Haswell 1970: 202; Leighton 1972: 48-124; Brühl 1986: 66, 163; Ohler 1989: 97-101; Castelnuovo 1996; Silverstein 2007: 191-3). The considerable amount of relevant scholarship – much more substantial than for sea and river transport costs – makes it impossible to provide even a short review of the complexities of the material (for which see Scheidel in preparation).</p>

<p>Mean daily travel distances have been set at 12 kilometers per day for ox carts, 20km/day for porters or heavily loaded mules, 30km/day for foot travelers including armies on the march, pack animals with moderate loads, mule carts, and camel caravans,[<a id="cite18" href="#fn18">18</a>] 36km/day for routine private vehicular travel with convenient rest stops, 50km/day for accelerated private vehicular travel, 56km/day for routine travel on horseback, 60km/day for rapid short-term military marches without baggage, 67km/day for fast carriages (state post or private couriers), and 250km/day for continuous horse relays (Scheidel in preparation). Except for the final option, which is primarily meant to provide an absolute speed ceiling for multi-day terrestrial information transfer, these transport options are predicated on movement during daytime. Adjustment for night travel would produce higher rates but would usually be feasible only in the short term.</p>

<p>The model seeks to generate values that would, on average, have been sustainable for days or weeks. Just as in the case of sea and river routes, the objective is to approximate the statistically average experience of a large number of travelers, an approach that necessitates critical engagement with individually reported performance times (Scheidel in preparation). In the absence of experimental data, the question of how the generally high quality of Roman surfaces affected travel speed compared to the experience of later periods of premodern history is difficult to address. Roman carriage design (e.g., Röring 1983) and harnessing systems (e.g., Raepsaet 2002, 2008), both of which continue to be subject to debate, were vital determinants of actual performance that complicate any attempt at comparison. To name just one example, comparative data suggest that even though by the late eighteenth century, improvements in roads and equipment sometimes enabled French fast carriages to cover considerably larger daily distances than in previous centuries, even then speeds that exceed corresponding values applied to our model simulations were confined to a few privileged routes (e.g., Renouard 1961: 116; Vigneron 1968: 171-2). We cannot therefore presuppose Roman travel speeds that were consistently far superior to those encountered in other premodern communication systems. Most Roman evidence is consistent with this conservative approach (e.g., Kolb 2000: 321-32 and Scheidel in preparation <span class="italic">contra</span> Laurence 1999: 81-2).</p>

<p>Uncertainty about the impact of grade on travel speed is perhaps the most important concern about simulations of time costs, especially for routes in mountainous terrain. Initial plans to model speed constraints as a function of road grade proved impracticable owing to a number of factors such as the imprecision of the road trajectories shown in Talbert 2000, lack of consistent information on road contours, and most importantly the paucity of relevant comparative historical evidence. Review of data for Alpine travel in the Middle Ages, when road conditions were inferior to those of the Roman imperial period, suggests that at least as far as individual travelers on horseback or in light carriages are concerned, grade did not represent a very serious impediment and did not systematically increase travel times except in extreme circumstances, notably at high-altitude mountain passes (e.g., Ludwig 1897: 108-9, 121, 126-7; Renouard 1961: 113; Castelnuovo 1996). Even winter conditions did not normally impose severe time costs on Alpine crossings (e.g., Ludwig 1897: 118-9; Renouard 1962; but cf. Castelnuovo 1996: 227). Increased travelers’ efforts to minimize time spent in the mountains may have helped maintain routine travel speeds, but this conjecture is not fully compatible with the observation that rest stops before and after mountain crossings are only rarely recorded. More importantly, time costs of heavy transport may well have been more significantly affected by grade. Relevant comparative data are badly needed to address this open question.</p>

<p>For the time being, speed adjustments for variation in altitude have only cautiously been applied to the model by adding three degrees of time cost (0.5, 1 and 1.5 extra days for routine vehicular travel and proportionate amounts for other means of transport; cf. Renouard 1962) to mountain roads depending on the scale of ascent and route length. These schematic constraints operate in the Pyrenees, Apennines and Alps and in mountain ranges in the Balkans, Anatolia, and the Maghreb. Seasonal constraints have been kept to a minimum by disallowing particular means of transport such as ox carts and fast carriages in certain winter months in the Pyrenees, Alps, and Taurus.[<a id="cite19" href="#fn19">19</a>] Due to this conservative approach, the model may understate the time cost of moving goods across difficult terrain, especially under unfavorable weather conditions. More generally, in all terrains, the model is less adept at taking account of seasonal speed variation for land routes than for <a href="#seatransport">sea routes</a>, which are simulated based on concrete monthly data. Users therefore have to bear in mind that in as much as terrestrial winter travel was undertaken at all (e.g., Ramsay 1904: 377), it might very well have been somewhat costlier than projected by the model.</p>

<h4 id="roadexpense">Expense<a href="#top"><img src="images/contents.png" width="100" height="12" border="0" /></a></h4>

<p>Freight charges have been set in accordance with the tetrarchic price edict of 301 CE that imposes ceilings on specific transportation costs. The relevant amounts are 2 <span class="italic">denarii communes</span> per Roman mile (c.1,478 meters) for a passenger in a carriage, 4 <span class="italic">denarii</span> for a donkey load per mile, 8 <span class="italic">denarii</span> for a camel load of 600 Roman pounds (194 kilograms) per mile, and 20 <span class="italic">denarii</span> for a wagon carrying 1,200 Roman pounds per mile (XVII.1-5). Although the weight of the donkey load is not specified, the model puts it at 300 pounds based on reported donkey and camel loads of wood of 200 and 400 pounds, respectively, elsewhere in the edict (XIV.9, 11), a value that is also consistent with comparative evidence (Vigneron 1968: 135; Cotterell et al. 1990: 194; Roth 1999: 205). These loads translate to expenses of 1.35 <span class="italic">denarii</span> per kilometer for a passenger, 0.028 <span class="italic">denarii</span> per kilogram of wheat carried by donkey or camel, and 0.035 <span class="italic">denarii</span> per kilogram of wheat per kilometer transported on a wagon. These three options are matched to three particular time cost options to allow the simultaneous computation of time and expense costs: the speed of transport by wagon is equated to that of a (mule) cart covering 30 kilometers per day, the donkey and camel are considered moderately loaded pack animals moving at the same speed,[<a id="cite20" href="#fn20">20</a>]  and the passenger is conjectured to move in the mode of accelerated private vehicular travel at 50 kilometers per day.</p>

<p>The implied ratio of the maximum freight charges for road and <a href="#rivertransport">river transport</a> is compatible with some later historical evidence (Dubois 1986: 290). Additional comparative data are required to put them in perspective. The simulated costs rates are best understood as quantitative illustrations of the overall scale of terrestrial transport costs, which were high compared to aquatic options. As a consequence, "fastest" and "cheapest" outcomes greatly differ in the model's simulations: whereas road travel was often faster than sailing, depending on the route and means of transportation, it was invariably more expensive even if it offered the most direct connections. Just as Roman travelers and merchants, users of the model have to choose between speed and price in plotting their paths.</p>

<h4 id="riverroutes">Routes</h4>

<p>River transport in the Roman period still awaits comprehensive study (relevant work includes Johnson 1936; Le Gall 1953; Rougé 1965; Sasel 1973; Eckoldt 1980; Deman 1987; de Izarra 1993; Jung et al. 1999; Laurence 1999: ch.8; Konen 2000; Bremer 2001; Salway 2004; Jones 2009; Cooper 2011). Campbell 2012 (esp. ch.6) is a welcome overview but far from exhaustive with regard to transportation issues. Detailed explorations of local or regional conditions (such as Eckoldt 1980 and Bremer 2001 for Roman Germany) show just how much would need to be done to appreciate the complexities of fluvial transport in the Roman period.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this model, we have confined coverage to major rivers and select tributaries which are known or likely to have been navigable all or most of the time. The crucial issue of navigability raises serious questions: some rivers that are navigable today reached this state only thanks to modern improvements while others that are not currently considered navigable may well have been negotiated by rafts and shallow vessels in the more distant past, at least for part of the year (e.g., Brewster 1832; <a href="http://www.european-waterways.eu/" target="_blank">http://www.european-waterways.eu/<img src="images/external.gif" width="12" height="11" /></a>; and miscellaneous internet resources). These shifting experiences make it extremely difficult to determine the accessibility of many ancient rivers. Even some of the major rivers included in our network, such as Rhone, Garonne and Seine (e.g., Brewster 1832; Denel 1970: 290; de Izarra 1993: 77), used to be subject to significant seasonal constraints. Only the lower reaches of the Tiber were navigable throughout the year (Pliny, <span class="italic">Letters</span>  5.6), and even the massive river Nile was continuously navigable only for boats up to 6 tons, and only half of the time for much larger vessels (Cooper 2011: 196). There are open questions about the navigability of the Orontes (K. Butcher, pers. comm.). Only segments of the major rivers of the Iberian peninsula or the Medjerda in the Maghreb would have been navigable and are therefore largely bracketed out. The status of rivers in the southern Balkans and Anatolia is likewise uncertain. It is also unclear whether canals made the Iron Gate area of the Danube passable for some river craft (Sasel 1973); the model conservatively assumes transport discontinuity at that location. During the Roman Warm Period, the focal point of our model, the freezing of rivers was probably only a moderate concern even in northern latitudes (cf. Ohler 1989: 13) although accounts of historical events on the frozen Danube and Rhine suggest that ice would at least on occasion have interrupted communications.</p>

<p>Very few canals have been included in the model. The <span class="italic">fossae Marianae</span> , for instance, are subsumed within the riverine sea port of Arelate, the canal linking the Nile to the Red Sea has been considered too transient to become a permanent element of the model, and the trajectory of the canal from Ravenna to Altinum and Aquileia is not provided by our main map source. The Tomis (Bahr Yusuf) canal has been amalgamated with the river Nile. Lakes, which played a role for transport in Alpine settings, have generally been excluded from our model, with no significant effect on cost.</p>

<p>The model's focus on major and reasonably reliable waterways is consistent with its overall emphasis on large-scale connectivity. We anticipate that further refinements will be undertaken as additional evidence is being reviewed, especially for the Iberian peninsula, the Maghreb and the Levant. It may seem as though frequently conservative assumptions about the navigability of major rivers and the exclusion of many minor rivers causes the model to underestimate the importance of river transport. However, any such concerns are put in context by questions about the role of this medium in the Roman world relative to other periods. It has been observed that the subsequent decline of the Roman road network precipitated a fluvialization of land transport in much of the Middle Ages, a trend that was reversed by renewed investment in higher-quality roads in more recent centuries (Lopez 1956). This suggests that in terms of overall importance, river routes may well have been overshadowed by the massive Roman network, which remained unparalleled until well into the late premodern period. The anti-cyclical character of river transport was another feature that might more generally have diminished its usefulness: outside Egypt, falling water levels rendered fluvial communications more difficult during the summer, at precisely the time when conditions on roads and the sea were most conducive to travel (e.g., Leighton 1972: 127; Ohler 1989: 33). These complexities call for a much more sophisticated approach to river transport than has so far been observed among Roman historians.</p>

<h4 id="rivertime">Time<a href="#top"><img src="images/contents.png" width="100" height="12" border="0" /></a></h4>

<p>The time cost of river transport is generally very poorly documented in ancient sources: with the exception of one reference to the Po the scarce data all pertain to the Nile (Scheidel in preparation). The model therefore relies primarily on comparative evidence from the medieval and early modern periods, which is likewise relatively rare but sufficient to establish a rough outline of plausible speed values (e.g., Brewster 1832; Thomas et al. 1880; Ludwig 1897: 184-5; Mollat 1952; Goitein 1967: 295-301; Denel 1970; Ellmers 1972; Leighton 1972: 126-8; Fasoli 1978; Lebecq 1988; Ohler 1989: 32-7). Historical records have been checked against more recent data on the velocity of river currents, which are a principal determinant of speed for vessels that are not towed or rowed (e.g., Prati et al. 1971; Hesselink et al. 2002, 2006; Saad 2002; Abdel-Fattah et al. 2004; van Gils 2004; Liska et al. 2008; and miscellaneous internet resources).</p>

<p>The application of contemporary information about river currents is problematic to the extent to which rivers have been transformed by modern improvements. This is a particular concern in parts of Europe where the straightening and shortening of rivers has increased their velocity. An extreme example is provided by the Rhine, which has been shortened by 105 kilometers or one-eighth of its length and for the most part has come to resemble a canal (Cioc 2005). In Egypt, by contrast, the construction of successive Aswan dams had the opposite effect by eliminating the strong currents historically associated with the Nile inundation. Historical flow data are occasionally available to address this problem (Hesselink et al. 2002, 2006; Cooper 2011).</p>

<p>The model reflects these various difficulties by keeping riverine speed variation to a minimum, allowing for rough adjustments only for major segments of some of the longest rivers in the network. The Nile is the only inland waterway for which the simulations recognize seasonal variation, which resulted from the interplay of flood and strong winds (Cooper 2011). Travel speed on many rivers is being simulated based on a review of historical data on travel times and current velocity, and generic default conditions apply in those cases where no specific information has been found.</p>

<p>The "civilian" mode of river travel supposes use of cargo vessels that mainly relied on currents for propulsion downriver, assisted by occasional sailing (which may only have been feasible on the widest rivers), and on towing for upriver movement. The "military" option envisions travel by fast oar-propelled vessels that may also have been equipped with sails (Konen 2000: 51-3; Himmler et al. 2009, with Bockius 2011).</p>

<p>In the "civilian" mode, the most common downriver speed is 65 kilometers per day (Tiber, Po, Arno, Rhine, Mosel, Rhone, Tyne, Ouse, Witham, Upper Seine, Upper Loire, Upper Garonne, Guadalquivir, Guadiana, Tagus, Upper Danube, Inn, Drava, Sava, Nisava, Middle Euphrates, Orontes, Khabur), with occasional rough adjustments to 75km (Upper Euphrates), 60km (Lower Loire and Garonne), 55km (Middle Danube), 50km (Lower Seine), and 45km (Lower Danube). Daily upriver speeds are set at 15km for all of these rivers except the Lower Tiber, the Rhone and the Euphrates (10km), the Lower Loire and Garonne and the Middle Danube (20km), the Lower Danube (25km), and the Lower Seine (30km). Conditions on the Nile were of considerable complexity but are rendered here in a highly simplified format to capture merely the main trends: downriver speeds in Lower Egypt are set at 90km from July to October and at 35km in other months, and at 100km from July to October and 50km in other months in Upper Egypt. The upriver values are 90km in Lower Egypt from July to October and 30km in other months, and 65km from July to October and 35km in other months in Upper Egypt. Canals are assigned a daily default rate of 15km in both directions that conservatively presupposes towing. The "military" mode is constant at 120km per day downriver and 50km upriver, which approximates the probable performance of oar-driven vessels.[<a id="cite21" href="#fn21">21</a>] </p>

<p>With the notable exception of Egypt, where northerly winds dominated, and with the partial exception of some rivers in Gaul that experienced Atlantic westerlies, upriver travel was a very slow and costly affair. Historical data have been employed in establishing the above speed rates but any simulation is called into question by uncertainty about the feasibility of towing by animals or people, which relies on accessible river banks (e.g., Bremer 2001: 87-90). The maintenance requirements inherent in this system of propulsion may further justify the model's focus on the main waterways, where adequate provisions were perhaps more likely to be available.</p>

<p>The simulations restrict travel to daylight hours, which is a conservative assumption given that at least during the summer boats may have navigated rivers at night (cf. also Horace, <span class="italic">Satires 5</span>). Certain very fast attested voyages imply continuous movement. This restriction stems from concerns that the provision of a continuous travel option might generate values that are too high to serve as plausible averages even in favorable conditions. The notional daytime values applied by the simulations are best seen as a hybrid between the outcome of genuine daylight travel and continuous travel, in that the projected daylight rates likely overstate actual daily averages, which would routinely have been affected by various kinds of interruptions and obstacles. The model thus compensates for the absence of a continuous travel option by projecting relatively high average values for daytime travel.</p>

<h4 id="riverexpense">Expense<a href="#top"><img src="images/contents.png" width="100" height="12" border="0" /></a></h4>

<p>Apart from a handful of freight charges reported in papyri from Roman Egypt (Johnson 1936: 407-8), the monetary cost of river travel is only attested in the tetrarchic price edict of 301 CE. Section XXXVA.31-33 of the Aphrodisias copy stipulates a maximum price of 1 <span class="italic">denarius communis</span> per <span class="italic">modius</span> (<span class="italic">kastrensis</span>?) for every 20 miles of downriver travel and of 2 <span class="italic">denarii</span> plus an unspecified food allowance per <span class="italic">modius</span> for every 20 miles going upriver.[<a id="cite22" href="#fn22">22</a>] Expressed in wheat equivalent, the edict’s price ceiling for downriver travel resembles actual short-haul charges in Roman Egypt (Scheidel in preparation). By contrast, the envisaged somewhat more than doubling of the cost for upriver travel seems overly conservative given the very considerable speed and energy advantages of downriver movement. However, in the absence of viable alternatives, the model adopts these rates for cargo, projecting a price of 0.0034 <span class="italic">denarii</span> per kilogram of wheat and kilometer of downriver travel and of 0.0068 per kilogram and kilometer upriver. In order to allow the movement of people across the whole network, the model simulates the cost of river travel for a passenger by applying the edict’s maritime cost conversion formula of 1 person = 25 <span class="italic">modii kastrenses</span> (XXXVA.26), resulting in charges of 0.86 (downriver) and 1.72 <span class="italic">denarii</span> (upriver) per passenger per kilometer.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that the price edict allows a discount for one particular longer voyage, an adjustment that can also be observed in relevant freight charges from Roman Egypt.[<a id="cite23" href="#fn23">23</a>] While our simulations do not currently adjust cost in relation to distance, this may be factored into a future iteration of the model. Comparative historical data may also have a role to play in this process (e.g., Hopkins 1980; Duncan-Jones 1982; Dubois 1986: 290; Langdon 1993; Masschaele 1993).</p>

<h3 id="future">The future of the project<a href="#top"><img src="images/contents.png" width="100" height="12" border="0" /></a></h3>

<p>This site represents merely the opening phase of our project. Future expansion may take various directions.</p>

<p>One option is intensification. The existing network may be augmented and fine-tuned by adding roads, rivers and sea ports as well as more detailed information on winds and currents and adjustments for grade. As noted in the section on "<a href="#" onclick="goRemoteTab(2,'understanding_tabs',0)">Understanding ORBIS,</a>" such additions would not change the broad picture but make the model more amenable to simulations on a micro-regional scale. We hope to explore this option by undertaking one or more regional case studies.[<a id="cite24" href="#fn24">24</a>] More comprehensive coverage of the road network would allow us to conduct an exhaustive test of the distances reported in Roman itineraries (cf. “Applying ORBIS”).</p>

<p>More importantly, this kind of intensification would open up new avenues for systematic analysis of the network properties of the entire system, an approach that is currently called into question by the possibility that the deliberately selective nature of our coverage might distort the findings.[<a id="cite25" href="#fn25">25</a>]</p>

<p>Intensification beyond the introduction of additional sites and routes might entail the provision of layers that contextualize our routes by visually portraying Roman landscapes as depicted in the <span class="italic">Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World</span>  (Talbert 2000),[<a id="cite26" href="#fn26">26</a>] or the application of a more flexible and realistic model of expense rates that transcend the overly schematic nature of the late Roman data used in the current simulations.</p>

<p>Spatial extension of the network is another option. Inclusion of the maritime routes of the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean would allow us to model the seasonal regime of the monsoon winds and to simulate Roman trade with South Arabia, West Africa, and India. Ancient documentation such as the <span class="italic">Periplus of the Erythraean Sea</span>  would facilitate this endeavor. Eastward extension of maritime connections could be complemented by the addition of caravan routes in the Arabian peninsula and the inclusion of southern Mesopotamia.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that our model of sea routes might in principle be extended over the entire planet. Data on winds and currents are available in a standardized format for most of the world’s oceans. Once a continuous global cost surface has been established, relatively minor adjustments of navigational capabilities based on specific historical evidence would suffice to enable the simulation of the voyages of the Norse, the Ming treasure fleets, or later European East or West Indiamen. We hope that colleagues specializing in other periods of history will seize this opportunity.</p>
<p>A third option is to transition from simulation of average outcomes to consideration of probabilities. The existing model offers a ready-made infrastructure for agent-based modeling that would allow the introduction of probabilistic simulations and evolutionary developments in response to environmental and other constraints. This approach promises an enhanced understanding of the structural properties of the network.</p>

<p>In addition to these options, our project has the potential to benefit from and contribute to existing databases of spatial information from the ancient world. Links to data-rich assemblages such as Pleiades (<a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/" target="_blank">http://pleiades.stoa.org/ <img src="images/external.gif" width="12" height="11" /><a>) and the Digital Atlas of Ancient and Medieval Civilizations (<a href="http://darmc.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do" target="_blank">http://darmc.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do <img src="images/external.gif" width="12" height="11" /></a>) or emerging applications such as Google Ancient Places (<a href="http://googleancientplaces.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">http://googleancientplaces.wordpress.com/ <img src="images/external.gif" width="12" height="11" /></a>) and Pelagios (<a href="http://pelagios-project.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">http://pelagios-project.blogspot.com/ <img src="images/external.gif" width="12" height="11" /></a>) would not only enrich our own model environment by providing historical context but also compensate for the built-in limitations of these resources: whereas conventional initiatives tend to focus on the accumulation of ever larger amounts of static factual information, our model prioritizes the dynamic elements of simulation and analysis.[<a id="cite27" href="#fn27">27</a>] Our ultimate goal is the creation of an interface that enables seamless integration of local data and dynamic processes. We are confident that other scholars will come to share this aspiration.</p>
