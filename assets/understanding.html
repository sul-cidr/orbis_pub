<h2>Understanding ORBIS</h2>
<h3>Managing expectations</h3>
<p>It is important to appreciate what this model can and cannot be expected to accomplish. Fernand Braudel, in his famous account of the Mediterranean in the sixteenth century, highlighted the "struggle against distance," against distance as the "first enemy" of premodern civilization (Braudel 1995: 355, 357). Our model seeks to improve our understanding of how a large-scale system such as the Roman Empire worked, of the effort it took to succeed in the struggle to connect and control tens of millions of people across hundreds and thousands of miles of land and sea. This objective informs the model's perspective: it is top-down, focusing on the system as a whole. Its simulations prioritize averages over particular outcomes; large-scale connectivity over local conditions; and the logical implications of choices over actual preferences. Each of these three key features is briefly explained in the following sections, and each of them must be understood to make proper use of the model.</p>

<h3>Particularity and structure</h3>

<p>Our model approximates the structural properties of Roman communication networks. Simulations of the costs associated with a given route are not meant to reflect the experience of any particular traveler. Rather, they seek to capture statistically average outcomes that cumulatively shaped the system as a whole. No one traveler would encounter such outcomes except by chance. The model simulates the average experience of a very large number of travelers taking the same route in a given month using a given mode and means of transport. It is this experience that is decisive for our understanding of how Roman networks operated. Patterns of connectivity were a function of average outcomes in the long term that shaped the choices of actors and hence the overall structure of the networks themselves. For this reason, particular simulations cannot be expected to match individually documented time costs unless such costs are reported as normative and were therefore used for the calibration of the model simulations, a process described in "<a href="#" onclick="goTab(3)">Building ORBIS</a>." Instead, they convey a sense of how any given route related to other routes in terms of typical cost. The structural features of the system that are determined by these relations are best expressed not through individual route simulations but in the form of distance cartograms that depict the consequences of employing specific modes and means of transportation across an entire network.</p> 

<p>The same principle applies to simulations of expense, which not only rely on a dataset of debatable value (the price controls of 301 CE) but are inevitably crude in eliding real-life variation in transportation prices. In the economic sphere, expense matters even more than speed, which makes it essential to attempt at least a rough approximation of the cost differences between particular modes of transport. The resultant projections should be taken in the spirit in which they are offered, as a preliminary sketch of the dramatic contrasts between terrestrial, fluvial, and maritime transportation expenses and the patterns they imposed on the flow of goods within the system overall. In as much as the Roman Empire critically depended on transfers driven by tributary redistribution and market exchange, even a highly schematic approximation of their underlying costs promises to make a significant contribution to our understanding of its achievements and limitations.</p>

<h3>Resolution and scope</h3>
<p>In keeping with its focus on systemic features, the model is in the first instance confined to the main arterial roads and other essential connectors of the Roman road network instead of seeking to reproduce it in its (known) entirety. Many minor rivers that are not included would have been navigated by rafts and shallow boats. The number of potential sea routes is vast, constrained only by the number of points of anchorage that might be connected across maritime space. By necessity and design, ORBIS models a simplified version of Roman connectivity. By necessity, given the workload associated with any serious attempt to track down every single Roman road and every navigable river, and especially with the computational burden of simulating discrete outcomes for tens of thousands of often only marginally different sea routes. Much the same is true of the cost of incorporating more detailed wind data or ubiquitous low-velocity surface currents, or of continually adjusting terrestrial speed for grade and river speed for variation in current (see "<a href="#" onclick="goTab(3)">Building ORBIS</a>)."</p>

<p>Yet the model is also limited by design. The most fundamental concern is not workload as such but return on investment: more fine-grained coverage would not significantly contribute to the overall objective of this project, which is to understand the dynamics of the Roman imperial system as a whole. The inclusion of minor land, river and sea routes or of more detailed terrain constraints would have little if any discernible effect on the broad picture. The model's utility is a direct function of the level of resolution: the smaller the scale of the simulation, the less likely the model is to approximate reality. Short-distance movement from one valley to the next or between adjacent islands may not be captured at all if low-tier connections are lacking, or only very crudely. The reliability and usefulness of the model increase with scale. It is therefore essential to ask appropriate questions, focusing on longer-range connectivity. In this respect, ORBIS differs from existing models that archaeologists and anthropologists employ in order to simulate local conditions. Our approach is not merely different but complementary: ORBIS is sufficiently flexible to accommodate detailed and more precise case studies of local movement simply by adding information for a given area. We are in the process of doing so for select regions, in a way that preserves the integrity of the baseline network.</p>

<p>Finally, in restricting coverage to the more important elements of the Roman communication system, the model not only maintains its emphasis on systemic features but also helps approximate ancient constraints. For instance, while much of the sea is in theory navigable without major restrictions, sailors would often follow established routes, and certain roads and rivers were more heavily used than others and hence more vital to the functioning of the system. The model's parsimonious coverage takes account of such preferences in order to avoid the simulation of a counterfactually optimized environment characterized by specious efficiencies and excessive choice.</p>

<h3>Options and constraints</h3>

<p>The model maximizes user options by keeping absolute constraints on movement to a minimum. Sea routes are assumed to be navigable at all times of the year unless a strong likelihood of rough weather (determined by wave height) shuts them down. River travel is similarly unconstrained, even though rivers may sometimes have been too shallow for navigation in the warm season or frozen in the winter. Roads are routinely classified as accessible although in practice they were seasonally vulnerable to snow, flooding, or sand storms. Minor restrictions on winter travel across certain mountain routes are the only constraints imposed on terrestrial movement. The modelâ€™s tolerance of unfavorable conditions is consistent with historical evidence that shows that travel was on occasion undertaken even in highly adverse circumstances: ships braved rough seas and armies crossed the Alps in the depths of winter. At the same time, this tolerance fails to give due weight to ancient preferences that might effectively have curtailed travel at certain times of the year.</p>

<p>This is not a serious problem. Any trip, however and whenever taken, was prone to unpredictable obstacles that cannot be accommodated within a generalized model. Simulated outcomes are based on projected averages that do not tell us about the probability that any particular route would have been taken at any particular time of the year. This should be seen as a strength rather than a weakness of the model: it places users in a position not entirely different from that of ancient travelers who had to make choices and cope with their consequences. It is true that unlike modern observers, these travelers had access to local knowledge that cannot readily be factored into the model. To address this deficit, simulations of trips that were likely to encounter seasonal hazards will soon be accompanied by pertinent warnings. It is feasible in principle to incorporate ancient preferences into the model: agent-based modeling would allow us to discriminate between routes depending on seasonal and other constraints and refine our understanding of hierarchies within the system. The current model is designed to provide infrastructure for such probabilistic simulations and we hope to expand our project in this direction (see "Building ORBIS: The future of the project").</p>
