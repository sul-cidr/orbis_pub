<p>ORBIS is the result of collaboration between historians and information technology specialists at Stanford University. The project was designed by <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~scheidel" target="_blank"><b>Walter Scheidel</b></a> <img src="images/external.gif"/>, a Roman historian in the Classics and History Departments at Stanford. Its implementation was made possible by a Stanford Digital Humanities grant that provided Scheidel with the support of three IT experts. The technology team was led by <a href="http://dhs.stanford.edu/" target="_blank"><b>Elijah Meeks</b> </a><img src="images/external.gif" /> and included geographer/web developer <a href="http://kgeographer.com/" target="_blank"><b>Karl Grossner</b> </a><img src="images/external.gif"/> and <b>Noemi Alvarez</b>. Scheidel and Meeks performed much of the work on the project.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:600">Walter Scheidel</span> identified all road, river and sea routes that were incorporated into the network; ranked all nodes according to significance; compiled a large set of Roman and other premodern evidence for the speed associated with different means of terrestrial transportation; gathered information on the navigability and flow velocity of rivers and (mostly comparative) data on the speed of river transport; collected hundreds of historically attested sailing times for specific sea routes; reviewed and evaluated information on currents in the Mediterranean, Black Sea and Atlantic; devised terrestrial speed adjustments for altitude variation; established expense rates for all road, river and sea routes based on a re-evaluation of the information in the tetrarchic price edict of 301 CE and comparative evidence; tested and calibrated sailing speed simulations with the help of historical records; compiled and researched the bibliography; proposed the design of this web site; and more generally worked closely with Meeks to develop the project from its inception to its current stage of development and supervised the input of other contributors.</p>

<p>As Technical Lead for ORBIS, <b>Elijah Meeks</b> developed the geographic information system (GIS) representing the ORBIS multimodal network of road, river and sea routes that can be queried for the shortest, cheapest and fastest routes (and price) in a given month, by any of several vehicle types, for shipping or passenger passage. Meeks also developed the interactive distance cartogram application and the route timeline accompanying the geographic map. He has also developed a number of static analytic maps of cost surfaces.</p>

<p><b>Karl Grossner</b> conceived and built the ORBIS web site as a digital scholarly publication, integrating Meeks' GIS routing application and supporting visualizations with an embedded scholarly article co-authored by Scheidel, Meeks, and two student contributors.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Ngu</b>, an aspiring interaction designer studying Computer Science and Art, was responsible for the bulk of the design of the new ORBIS interface.</p>
<p>In the autumn quarter of 2011, Scheidel organized a graduate seminar that encouraged Stanford students to become involved in the project. Members of this group made contributions of varying significance. Credit is due above all to <b>Jonathan Weiland</b>, who entered most road routes into the model and established geographical coordinates for many nodes, and to <b>Scott Arcenas</b>, who identified the meteorological data required for creating a maritime cost surface and successfully devised a novel algorithm that allowed us relate wind conditions to navigational capabilities and thereby to simulate sailing speeds. Further substantial contributions were made by <b>Dan-el Padilla Peralta</b>, who tested measured road lengths against distances reported in Roman itineraries, and by <b>Federica Carugati</b>, who served as Scheidel’s research assistant in the final phase of the project. <b>Mark Pyzyk</b> gathered both meteorological and historical data for sea travel in the Black Sea, which were not available in the same format as the Mediterranean maritime data, and <b>Hans Wietzke</b> compiled a very detailed set of land routes in Egypt including the desert, only a small part of which could be incorporated here and which will be useful for a future regional case study. <b>Eunsoo Lee</b> gathered information on the names and construction dates of Roman roads. <b>Megan Daniels</b>, Carugati and <b>Sienna Kang</b> collated information from a main reference work for the western, central and eastern Mediterranean, respectively, and (together with several others) established geographical coordinates and calculated wind conditions. <b>Anja Krieger</b> looked for information on Atlantic sea routes, which are not well represented in the record, and <b>Julie Baleriaux</b> and <b>Camille Gandhi</b> did some preliminary work on rivers.</p>
<p>The interface and functionality of ORBIS was further enhanced in 2013-2014 with significant digital humanities support from Stanford University Library. This upgrade was also supported by the <a href="https://cesta.stanford.edu">Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (CESTA)</a>, which provided funding for the GIS necessary to add the high resolution routes as well as undergraduate research assistants to support user interface and user experience improvement.</p>
<p>We have also benefited from occasional input by colleagues from outside Stanford. Thanks are due to <b>Brian Campbell</b> for sharing his chapter on Roman river travel in advance of the publication of his book <span class="italic">Rivers and the power of ancient Rome</span>; to <b>Justin Leidwanger</b> for presenting his own model of sea travel in the northeastern Mediterranean to our group and making his unpublished dissertation available; to <b>Carlos Norena</b> for introducing us to his Berkeley-based project on the distribution of urban settlements in the Greco-Roman world; to <b>J. L. V. González</b> and <b>Shawn Graham</b> for sending us papers; and to <b>Richard Talbert</b> for advice and friendly encouragement.</p><p></p>
