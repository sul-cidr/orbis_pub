<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>The following sample simulations illustrate specific features of the route simulation tool in Mapping ORBIS. Further examples may be added later in response to user feedback.</p>

<h3>Time, price, and distance</h3>

<p>A long-range route simulation from Carthago (in present-day Tunisia) to Londinium (London) highlights difference in outcomes depending on priority, mode, and season.</p>

<div class="inlinepic"><img src="images/examples_fig01_540w.png" alt="Fig01"> </div>

<p>In the month of July, generally a favorable time of the year for travel, the fastest connection utilizing all four modes (road travel by pack animal, river travel by civilian boat, open sea and coastal sea travel on the faster sailing ship) is represented by the purple line that crosses the western Mediterranean in a northwesterly direction, cuts across southwestern Gaul (France) in part by using the river Garonne and subsequently follows the Atlantic coast to the final destination. Travel time is 27.2 days over a distance of 3,099km (or 114km/day), at a cost of 7.8 <span class="italic">denarii</span> per kilogram using a donkey for land transport. Disabling the open sea function diverts the fastest route to track the coast of Sicily and Italy, a change that increases travel time by 40 percent to 37.4 days and distance by the same rate to 4,384km (or 117km/day), while the price rises by no more than one-eighth to 8.8 <span class="italic">denarii</span> thanks to the continuing predominance of cheap maritime travel. The low price cost of sailing also accounts for the fact that the cheapest route overall for the original four modes and settings (displayed in green) takes a very different path, relying as it does as much as possible on the sea and therefore completing virtually the entire voyage by sea ship, a choice that results in a comparable travel time of 37 days over a longer distance of 5,097km (or 138km/day) but halves the price to merely 3.7 <span class="italic">denarii</span>/kg.</p>

<p>This route depends on access to Atlantic shipping: an easy way of excluding this particular option is by selecting the same configuration of modes and settings for the month of January, when heavy winds curtailed sailing in the Atlantic Ocean. This creates a dramatically different path, represented by the green line that initially curves across the western Mediterranean in order to avoid the area of rough winter weather west of Sardinia and later relies as much as possible on river transport, first up the Rhone and then down the Rhine, before sailing to the mouth of the Thames. In this scenario, travel time increases massively to 93.2 days over 3,361km (or 36km/day) while the price rises fourfold to 15.7 <span class="italic">denarii</span>/kg. The yellow route (for the original modes and settings, in July), partly obscured by (purple) the sea route from Carthago to Narbo (Narbonne), shows the physically shortest route, which at 2,403km is almost a quarter shorter than the fastest route but, at 36.2 <span class="italic">denarii</span>/kg, also far more expensive than any of the others because it does not shy away from expensive road travel.</p>

 <div class="inlinepic"><img src="images/examples_fig02_540w.png" alt="Fig02"> </div>

<p>This particular simulation also serves to illustrate the consequences of discontinuity in the Roman road network. Although most sites in our network are accessible by road, except for those on smaller islands, along the northern Black Sea coast, promontories and a few other isolated coastal sites, the gap in the Roman road system on what is now the northeastern coast of Morocco (along the Rif mountain massif) forces non-maritime travel from Carthago to Londinium on an absurdly circuitous route around the entire Mediterranean basin that would have taken almost nine months of travel on foot or by pack animal.</p>

<h3>Composite routes</h3>

<p>This deliberately counterfactual example shows that composite routes may sometimes be necessary to achieve historically plausible outcomes: the longer a given route, the more often a single configuration of modes and options will generate implausible simulations. In such cases, routes need to be spliced by selecting modes and means of travel that are appropriate to particular segments of the overall route.</p>

 <div class="inlinepic"><img src="images/examples_fig03_540w.png" alt="Fig03"> </div>

<p>In the above-mentioned case, if the objective is to reach Londinium from Carthago by prioritizing road travel but without going to the extremes of a nine-month trip around the entire Mediterranean basin, the most economical approach involves road travel from Carthago to Rusaddir (Melilla) followed by a short sea crossing to Gades (Cadiz) and more road travel all the way to the English Channel. This hybrid route cuts travel time by half, from nine to four-and-a half months.</p>

 <div class="inlinepic"><img src="images/examples_fig04_540w.png" alt="Fig04"> </div>

<p>A further example of the characteristics of composite routes is provided by simulation of travel from Roma (Rome) to Athenae (Athens). By faster sea ship and using a fast carriage for the very short land legs of this almost entirely maritime voyage, the route that runs south to the Strait of Messina and east to the Isthmus of Corinth and on to Athens requires 10.2 days of travel in July. Undertaken wholly by land, in a fast carriage, the same trip (around the entire Adriatic) would take much longer, 33.4 days, whereas a 24-hour horse relay narrowly beats the sailing option by 0.7 days. The fastest route overall, however, is a hybrid, using a horse relay from Rome across Italy to Brundisium (Brindisi), crossing the Strait of Otranto to Dyrrhachium (Durres) by ship, and continuing to Athens again by horse relay, for a total travel time of 6.4 days. If a fast carriage is used on the land segments of this spliced route, travel time increases to 20.6 days, twice as long as the sailing option and only 40 percent faster than the land-only option by fast carriage.</p>

<p>What does this kind of thought experiment mean for historians? The model projects average travel times, but mean outcomes might have been easier to ensure on land than by sea: while a sea trip of 10.2 days seems faster than a hybrid trip of 20.6 days involving a fast carriage, the latter option might well have been more reliable. Moreover, it would probably have been easier to send a carriage of the state post across Italy and the southern Balkans than to find a ship that was to sail directly from Rome to central Greece. Horse relays would have sped things up but must also have been very costly and as far as we can tell were very rarely employed even on urgent state business. Particular simulations are not meant to tell us what would have happened: they are primarily meant to provide food for thought, to give us a better sense of a range of possible outcomes that in practice would have been determined by context and highly contingent priorities.</p>

<h3>Open sea and coastal sea routes</h3>

 <div class="inlinepic"><img src="images/examples_fig05_540w.png" alt="Fig05"> </div>

<p>Open sea routes were the backbone of long-range connectivity in the Roman empire. Their critical importance is underscored by the consequences of their absence. For example, in July a faster sea ship was capable of reaching Rhodos (Rhodes) from Alexandria in Egypt in five days and six nights (along the purple route) but would have taken two weeks to complete the same trip via the Levantine coast and Cyprus (along the green route).</p>

<h3>Seasonal and directional variation</h3>

<p>Seasonal variation is captured by the different paths of the fastest/cheapest sailing route from Rome to Alexandria.</p>

 <div class="inlinepic"><img src="images/examples_fig06_540w.png" alt="Fig06"> </div>

<p>The most conspicuous change occurs in the winter, when the Strait of Messina became more hazardous and therefore, in terms of our model, more costly. This projected detour should not be taken to suggest that ships actually chose the longer route around Sicily: it merely signals the fact that this particular option would <span class="italic">on average</span> have been less costly than delays awaiting safe passage between Sicily and Italy. Lesser monthly deviations, caused by variation in wind conditions, are visible along much of the route.</p>

 <div class="inlinepic"><img src="images/examples_fig07_540w.png" alt="Fig07"> </div>

<p>The impact of wind on the path of the optimal sailing route, in July, from Rome to Alexandria (in purple) and from Alexandria to Rome (in green) illustrates directional variation, tracking the documented open sea route between eastern Crete and Alexandria as well as the alternative route via Lycia and/or Rhodes (cf. Arnaud 2005: 212).</p>

<h3>Optimization</h3>

<p>For a few maritime route simulations, the principle that the model always searches for the optimal route (in terms of the selected priority of speed or price) results in slight detours. This is because it may sometimes be faster or cheaper to take a longer route that bypasses intermediate sites but overshoots the destination and subsequently turns back to reach it than to approach the target via a series of adjacent ports. Substantial distortions caused by this process have been eliminated by reconfiguring certain routes, and its remaining impact is minor and now largely confined to the highly articulated Aegean coastline.</p>

 <div class="inlinepic"><img src="images/examples_fig08_540w.png" alt="Fig08"> </div>

<p>The modest significance of this phenomenon can be illustrated by simulating a maritime trip from Rhodos to Samos, which first goes to Ephesus, to which Rhodos is linked by a direct sea route, and then back to Samos, a detour that adds only a fraction of a day to the duration of the voyage.</p>

<h3>Small-scale connectivity</h3>

<p>As explained in <a href="#" onclick="goRemoteTab(2,'understanding_tabs',0)">Understanding ORBIS</a>, selective coverage of existing Roman routes may at times make short-range connections appear costlier than they would have been in practice.</p>

 <div class="inlinepic"><img src="images/examples_fig09.png" alt="Fig09"> </div>

<p>For instance, the shortest available land route from Londinium (London) to Lindum (Lincoln) in the network runs through Verulamium (St Albans) and Venonis (High Cross, Leics.) despite the fact that a roughly parallel but more direct road connection existed between London and Lincoln (Talbert 2000: 8). In this particular case, inclusion of every element of the unusually well-documented Roman road system in Britain would have introduced imbalances into our network and not added much of significance to its overall degree of connectivity. The available route was selected in the first instance because of its presence in two major Roman itineraries, the Antonine Itinerary and the Peutinger Table, which points to its general importance.</p>

 <div class="inlinepic"><img src="images/examples_fig10.png" alt="Fig10"> </div>

<p>In Egypt, widespread uncertainty about the precise location of Roman roads accounts for the fact that certain sites that (in Mapping ORBIS) are not visibly connected to the road or river networks may nevertheless be part of them. Thus, it is possible to travel by road and canal/river from Krokodilopolis (Faiyum) to Oxyrhynchus (el-Bahnasa) on the Bahr Yusuf canal even though the latter site is not visibly connected either to the road (which is a simplified rendition of more complex infrastructure) or the Nile (which in our model subsumes the Bahr Yusuf). (For further discussion, see Building ORBIS.)</p>

<h3>Price results</h3>

 <div class="inlinepic"><img src="images/examples_fig11.png" alt="Fig11"> </div>

<p>As mentioned in the Overview section of Using ORBIS, price results are displayed in two ways. For trips that do not involve land travel, prices are based on the selected sea ship speed and on use of a civilian river boat, where applicable: in the shown example, the entire trip is undertaken by sea ship, hence the qualification "where applicable." Prices refer to the two types of cargo modeled for aquatic travel, 1 kilogram of wheat and a passenger.</p>

 <div class="inlinepic"><img src="images/examples_fig12.png" alt="Fig12"> </div>

<p>By contrast, the fastest route from Ostia/Portus to Hadrianoupolis (Edirne, in the hinterland of Constantinopolis) involves two short segments of road travel, across the Isthmus of Corinth and from Perinthus on the Sea of Marmara to the final destination. In a case like this, the price results also include outcomes for the three types of road cargo that can be modeled: 1 kilogram of wheat carried by a donkey or camel, the same item conveyed by a wagon, and a passenger in a carriage.</p>

 <div class="inlinepic"><img src="images/examples_fig13.png" alt="Fig13"> </div>

<p>As shown in the final example, sea and river options are mentioned even if a trip takes place entirely by road, as in the route from Perinthus to Hadrianoupolis. This does not mean that any pricing based on aquatic transport is actually included in these price results: hence, again, the qualification "where applicable."</p>
