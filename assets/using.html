<h2>Using ORBIS</h2>
<p>ORBIS is an Interactive Scholarly Work created around a transportation model of the Roman world. As such, there are several different ways to access the information stored in this work:</p>
<h4>Finding Routes</h4>

<p>The interactive route map is the principal interface for our transportation model. To establish a historical route from one of the sites in our model to another, you simply select the start and destination sites from the two drop-down lists. Sites are named in accordance with <span class="italic">The Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World</span> Routes differ depending on whether you are looking for the fastest, cheapest or shortest connection, on the modes and means (here called options) of transport, and on the month of the year.</p>
<p>Click "calculate route" to obtain cost information and a path for the route you have selected. Fastest routes are displayed in purple, cheapest routes in green, and shortest routes in yellow.</p>
<p>"Fastest" calculates the route that takes the least amount of time. Its path is highly dependent on the type of transportation you select. For example, faster land speeds may obviate the need for usually fast but often indirect sea travel.</p>
<p>"Cheapest" gives you the route with the lowest total cost priced in <span class="italic">denarii</span> (<span class="italic">communes</span>), a late Roman currency denomination used in the records from which we derive our price simulations. Price costs based on the modes and means of transport you choose. Transport of goods (exemplified by grain) and passenger travel incur different costs, and the price of grain transport on land varies depending on whether it is carried out by pack animals or wagons. As a result, there could be three different cheapest routes between two points.</p>
<p>"Shortest" only takes account of total distance, via the transportation network, from one point to another. The shortest route will often not be the fastest or cheapest one.</p>
<p>When you first access the map, all principal network modes are enabled by default except for high resolution routes. Disable individual modes as desired. Open sea and coastal sea routes operate 24 hours a day. Both of these modes must be enabled to access the complete maritime route network. Coastal sea routes and coastal sea (daytime) routes cannot be enabled at the same time. For travel on rivers, choose between a faster military boat and a slower civilian boat. A faster and a slower sailing option are available for sea travel. The interface offers a variety of road options: each of the speed options corresponds to a specific daily travel speed. Speed options are only available for queries for fastest and shortest connections. Each of the price options corresponds to a specific expense for a cargo unit or passenger. Price options are only available for queries for cheapest connections.</p>
<p>If you want to find out how your route changes if you avoid travel by land, river, open sea or coastal sea lanes, deselect particular modes from this menu. For instance, if you only want to use coastal sea routes, simply uncheck the "Open sea" box. Note that unchecking boxes renders sites inaccessible if they can only be reached by the deselected modes of travel.</p>
<p>You can also remove individual sites by clicking on that site and clicking "Exclude" or by clicking the "Select Sites" button and selecting multiple sites.</p>
<p>Cost results appear in the "Calculated route" box in the lower left-hand corner of the map. All results include the required days of travel (rounded to one decimal point) and the distance covered (in kilometers). Queries for routes that do not involve road travel generate prices based on sea and/or (civilian) river transport. Queries for routes that involve road travel generate prices that take account of all types of road travel for which specific historical price information is available, regardless of whether these are actually employed in the calculated route.</p>
<p>As you query routes, they appear both on the map and in a simple timeline that shows each stop below the map. The timeline displays the name of each site when you move your mouse over it. The distance between each site can be contrasted with time and expense by clicking on the corresponding buttons above the timeline.</p>
<p>You may also view your results in a grid by clicking on "History". This function even allows you to download your routes as individual PNGs.</p>
<h4>Network Diagrams and Clustering</h4>

<p>Available by clicking the "Network" tab or by clicking on a site and clicking "Network", you can calculate the distance, time or expense to or from one site to all the other sites in the network.</p>
<p>After calculating a network, you can display the results territorially as an isochronal or isophoretric map by clicking "Zones" or distort the geographic representation of the paths and sites using a dynamic distance cartogram by clicking "Cartogram".</p>
<p>If you calculate two or more networks of the same priority, you can cluster the results by clicking "Cluster".</p>
<h4>Flow Diagrams</h4>
<iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/E7KbvjIU9Y4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>The final diagram available is a flow diagram that aggregates the paths calculated to or from a site by segment. The popularity of individual segments are indicated by the thickness of the segment in the diagram.</p>
<p>This can be accessed by clicking the "Flow" tab or by clicking on an individual site and clicking "Flow".</p>
