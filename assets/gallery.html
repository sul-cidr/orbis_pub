<p>The following maps offer a few examples of how the time and price cost of transport structured the Roman world.</p><div><h3>Isochrone Map of Travel Time to Rome in July</h3><img src="images/gallery/ttr_800.png" alt="Duration of trips to Rome in July based on aggregated model results"></div> <div><h3>Isochrone Map of Travel Time from Rome in July</h3><img src="images/gallery/tfr_800.png" alt="Duration of trips from Rome in July based on aggregated model results"></div><div><h3>Difference in Duration of Travel Based on Direction</h3><img src="images/gallery/dd_800.png" alt="Duration difference of trips to or from Rome based on aggregated model results"><p>Note how the strong winds and currents in the Bosporus and Dardanelles slow maritime travel into the Black Sea.</p></div><div><h3>Isophoretric Map of Transport Cost to Rome in January</h3><img src="images/gallery/iph1_800.png" alt="Isophoretric Map of Transport Cost to Rome in January"></div> <div><h3>Isophoretric Map of Transport Cost to Rome in July</h3><img src="images/gallery/iph7_800.png" alt="Isophoretric Map of Transport Cost to Rome in July"></div><div>
<h3>Difference in Expense Based on Month</h3><img src="images/gallery/cd_800.png" alt="Cost difference between June and July based on aggregated model results">
<p>Note how the interruption of Atlantic shipping increases transportation costs in the northwestern periphery.</p></div><div><h3>Duration-Based Distance Cartogram, All Modes</h3><img src="images/gallery/dur_all_800.png" alt="Duration-Based Distance Cartogram, All Modes"><p>This cartogram shows the speed advantage of sea travel relative to slower land travel on foot and by pack animal.</p></div><div><h3>Duration-Based Distance Cartogram, No Open Sea</h3><img src="images/gallery/dur_land_800.png" alt="Duration-Based Distance Cartogram, All Modes"><p>Note how the absence of open sea routes increases travel time across the Mediterranean basin.</p></div><div><h3>Duration-Based Distance Cartogram, Roads Only</h3><img src="images/gallery/dur_road_800.png" alt="Duration-Based Distance Cartogram, Roads Only"><p>EXP: Note how the discontinuity of the Roman road network in Morocco distorts this network.</p></div><div><h3>Expense-Based Distance Cartogram, All Modes, Log-Normalized</h3><img src="images/gallery/exp_log_800.png" alt="Expense-Based Distance Cartogram, All Modes, Log-Normalized"><p>Log-normal representation allows us to label nodes near the center but obscures cost increases in the periphery.</p></div><div><h3>Expense to Ship to Rome, by Site</h3><img src="images/gallery/expdot_800.png" alt="Expense to Ship to Rome, by Site"><p>This cost distribution map illustrates favorable conditions for economic integration along the Mediterranean coast and low levels of connectivity between the Mediterranean core and the interior of the Iberian peninsula and of Gaul, the Danube basin, central Anatolia and the Egyptian deserts.</p></div><div><h3>Distance Cartogram with Route Type</h3><img src="images/gallery/dc_l_800.png" alt="Distance Cartogram with Route Type"><p>This distance cartogram illustrates massive differences in transport costs by sea (concentrated in the innermost center of the map) and by land and river. The clustering of sites near the center prevents labeling.</p></div><div><h3>Distance Cartogram, Labeled</h3><img src="images/gallery/lab_800.png" alt="Distance Cartogram with Route Type"><p>This is an alternative rendering of the previous map. The labeled sites are among the most remote from Rome in terms of transport price cost.</p></div>
