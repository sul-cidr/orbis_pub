ORBIS v2

This is a pure D3.js version of ORBIS ( http://orbis.stanford.edu ) that introduces several new features:

* Dynamic base layer to contrast route type with speed and expense
* Capacity to remove sites from the pathfinding algorithm (click on a site and click "Remove")
* Dynamic labeling (click on a site and click "Label")
* Capacity to run cartograms from any site using the active settings in the routing interface (click on a site and click "cartogram")
* Cluster cartogram results of similar types (run a couple cartograms using the same priority and then click "Cluster")
* Draw regions of cluster results (Borders button in the cartogram modal dialogue)
* Mapbox base layer using d3.geo.tile
* TopoJSON for efficiency and, hopefully, even more interesting cartograms

There are many missing features, inconsistencies and poor UI/HCI/UX/ETC that could be improved with the input and support of the community.
